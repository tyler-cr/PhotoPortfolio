# TO ADD:
- **cleanup code**
- **implement Pam Design ideas**
- **make cool square image carousel for gallery photos**
- **Edit photos with scratches and other ugly stuff**




## DONE:
- Have images fade in (do this after the nine images / generate more addition is completed)
- Create contact page.
- Navbar on mobile hides if active and user starts scrolling.
- If user clicks on image, has 2/3 screensize pop-up with image.
- Find a way to not have to hardcode each page and how many images are in the file

    Hardcoding, at least without any backend stuff, is just a better, MUCH faster solution. Maybe come back to.
  
- Give popup image a lil outline incase the photo looks like it bleeds too much into the background

- Each Page only starts with 9 images. Have button that allows more to generate. [wip]

    This still need to have updated css and just general "don't look like dookie" updates. But it's functional now, so there's that.

  ~~THIS NEEDS TO BE PRIORITIZED. WITH THE NEW CLASS DICTIONARY SYSTEM, THE IMAGES DONT SHOW UP UNTIL THEY'RE ALL LOADED. FOR PAGES WITH 100+ IMAGES, THAT IS BAD!!!~~

- Git ignore the bridge file
- Add a "copy email to clipboard" button on the copyboard
- implement Pam Design ideas
   
## Canceled:
- make highlighting on the contact page easier

  Apparently, this is REALLY tricky. Like, not really possible tricky. Soooo that's why we did the button instead. I did try, but struggled a lot, and succombed to the internet answer of "this no workie"
- See if you can get some of the image metadata on the image pop-up

  Without a library, this isn't really feasible. And making it work out of library is probably VERY out of scope for this project. Regardless, a lot of these are scans, so the metadata wouldn't be great anyway.
- Space images so that they line up on the bottom all with one another

  Implemented, and immediately said "nope" before I even commited. It just does not look good. A part of the appeal if the site is that you can always see the images on your screen. When they're that small, that's no longer true.
- Create an actual splash page instead of just immediately going to full gallery

  Having the og index as the starting page might actually be the move honestly. IDK, will talk to more people about it, but for now putting in the Cancelled pile.
