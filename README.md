# TO ADD:
- Each Page only starts with 9 images. Have button that allows more to generate.
- Space images so that they line up on the bottom all with one another.
- cleanup css
- See if you can get some of the image metadata on the image pop-up
- Have images fade in (do this after the nine images / generate more addition is completed)
- Create an actual splash page instead of just immediately going to full gallery
- make cool square image carousel for gallery photos (WIP)
- do same (^) but for other select pieces
- git ignore the bridge file
- make highlighting on the contact page easier

## DONE:
- Create contact page.
- Navbar on mobile hides if active and user starts scrolling.
- If user clicks on image, has 2/3 screensize pop-up with image.
- Find a way to not have to hardcode each page and how many images are in the file
- Give popup image a lil outline incase the photo looks like it bleeds too much into the background
