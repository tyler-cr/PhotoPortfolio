# TO ADD:
- Each Page only starts with 9 images. Have button that allows more to generate.
- Space images so that they line up on the bottom all with one another.
- If user clicks on image, has 2/3 screensize pop-up with image (WIP)
- Find a way to not have to hardcode each page and how many images are in the file
- cleanup css


## DONE:
- Create contact page.
- Navbar on mobile hides if active and user starts scrolling.
